FALLBACK FORMAT (Simple Format):
================================

If the structured format above is not used, the system can also parse a simpler format where:
- Problem statements are separated by blank lines
- Each PS starts with a number followed by the title
- Remaining lines are treated as the description

Example:

1. Authentication System
Build a secure authentication system with multi-factor authentication.
Should include password hashing, session management, and rate limiting.

2. Traffic Management
Develop an AI-powered traffic management system.
Must analyze real-time traffic data and optimize signal timings.


BEST PRACTICES:
===============

1. Always use the structured format with DOMAIN headers for better organization
2. Include all three main sections: Problem Context, Objective, and Expected Deliverables
3. Be specific in the Objective section about what needs to be achieved
4. List concrete, measurable deliverables
5. Assign appropriate difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
6. Use consistent numbering (X.Y format where X is domain number)
7. Ensure Problem Context provides sufficient background information
8. Make objectives clear and actionable
9. Include 3-5 expected deliverables per problem statement
10. Keep formatting consistent throughout the document


SPECIAL TRACK (DEVNOVATE):
==========================

For the Devnovate Special Track, use the admin interface to add:
- Title: Name of the special problem statement
- Overview/Description: Brief description shown to participants
